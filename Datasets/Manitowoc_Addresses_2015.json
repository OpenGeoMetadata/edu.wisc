[The address point data set contains the situs or physical address locations in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. The file was created by geocoding the addresses in a telephone directory database against a road centerline file containing address ranges. The mapped points were then moved on top of their corresponding buildings using digital orthophotography as a basemap. Manitowoc Countydoes not issue addresses, but relies on information supplied by the thirty municipalities located in the county to keep the data set current.]",
