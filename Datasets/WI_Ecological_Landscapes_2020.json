[Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin are aggregations of NHFEU (National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units) subsections that have been assigned descriptive names. The Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin are represented on a May, 1999 map prepared under the direction of the DNR Division of Land Ecosystem Management Planning Team. The NHFEU concept, developed by the USFS, is considered one of the oldest and best-documented ecosystem classification schemes at the federal level. The NHFEU has been refined over the years as new information becomes available to identify lower levels of the hierarchy.]",
