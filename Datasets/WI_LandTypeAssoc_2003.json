This data is reviewed annually.Agencies that participated on the Wisconsin LTA Project Team include theWisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Natural Resources ConservationService, the USDA Forest Service (State and Private Forestry and NationalForests), the Wisconsin County Forest Association, the University of Wisconsin (atMadison and Stevens Point), Menominee Tribal Enterprise, and the WisconsinGeological and Natural History Survey.The LTA delineations in the NHFEU dataset are presented as an ArcInfo Regionfeature class ('region.lta').
