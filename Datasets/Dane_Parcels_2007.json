[The Dane County Tax Parcel dataset was derived from a variety of source maps including U.S. General Land Office survey plats, deed descriptions, subdivision plats, certified survey maps and right-of-way plats. All new parcels are entered into the database using coordinate geometry (COGO). The map provides a representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels. It is not intended to be used for the legal determination of land ownership or to be in any way a substitute for the land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds.]",
