Each State Forest identified a list of priority search areas for invasive plant surveys using maps and forest staff input. Priority areas include corridors along roads and trails, homesteads, boat landings, river ways, timber sales, gravel pits, recreational sites and campgrounds.", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "D53956D4-8666-4BF0-B0E1-89624521305D", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point","layer_modified_dt": "2022-01-22T20:12:43Z", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide", "Wisconsin State Agencies"], "dc_creator_sm": ["Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Biota"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2008"], "solr_year_i": 2008, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_StForest_Invasives_2008.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/ForestManagement/data.html\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_StForest_Invasives_2008.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-92.943909, -87.683472, 46.786534, 43.80436)", "uw_supplemental_s": "Please refer to INVxW9xx_shp_dd.doc (Data Dictionary) for more detailed attribute information.
