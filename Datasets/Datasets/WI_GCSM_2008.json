The results of the GCSM are illustrated in a map published in 1987 at a scale of 1:1,000,000 (available from the Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey: http://wgnhs.uwex.edu/maps-data/maps/", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "CF9E8298-63E5-43C7-9E8A-DEDCB93C1519", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon","layer_modified_dt": "2022-01-22T20:12:43Z", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide", "Wisconsin State Agencies"], "dc_creator_sm": ["Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Geoscientific Information"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2008"], "solr_year_i": 2008, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_GCSM_2008.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"http://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/groundwater-contamination-susceptibility-model\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_GCSM_2008.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-92.962438, -86.711046, 47.058571, 42.458042)", "uw_supplemental_s": "For more information about the GCSM and its component layers, refer to the DNR publication, Wisconsin's Groundwater Management Plan: Report No. 5: Groundwater Contamination Susceptibility in Wisconsin, available from the DNR Bureau of Drinking Water & Groundwater: http://dnr.wi.gov/org/water/dwg/", "uw_notice_s": ""}
