[The Six Year Transportation Improvement Program layer displays projects that reflect the department's intent to improve the state and local highway system based on assumptions about available revenue, inflation and legislative decisions. As these assumptions change, so does the program. Therefore, project listings may change in the future. For more information, please visit the Six Year Highway Program webpage. Project information updates are paused in January for annual maintenance and resume updating at the end of January.]",
