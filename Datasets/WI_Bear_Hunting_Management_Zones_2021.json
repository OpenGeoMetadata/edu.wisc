Bear Management Zones indicate the areas with various bear hunting regulations throughout Wisconsin. Hunting regulations may vary between and within zones. Users should consult the most recent Hunting Regulations Handbook to determine which regulations apply to which zones, or portions of zones. Bear Management Zones allow the DNR to better control the distribution of hunters and shift hunting pressure to areas of high nuisance and/or damage complaints.]",
