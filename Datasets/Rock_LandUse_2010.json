[The Rock County Land Use Inventory was designed using a Classification System designed by Planning Staff to be able to capture land use traits important in staff decisions. The main purpose of the inventory is to is to descrive what actually takes place in physical or observable terms. The land use classification definitions and a look up table are attached to the metadata as enclosures. To access them, in ArcCatalog click on the metadata properties button on the metadata toolbar.Please note:The classification system in this Inventory is NOT COMPATIBLE with the APA LBCS that was used in the 2000 Land Use Inventory. Users SHOULD NOT use the numerical codes as a basis of analysis between the two data sets.]",

Orthophotos and Pictometery images were used to analyze the land use that could be identified from the observation of the parcel (e.g. cropland, cemeteries, etc.). When the identity of land use could not be obtained using orthophotos and Pictometry provided by Rock County, imagery from Bing and Google maps were used for a second and third observational source. If the land use could not be identified through observation of photogrammetry, a combination of select feature classes were used to help identify the land use. A Google search of the address was conducted for identifying the land use classification in addition to the combined previous methods if the land use was still in question. For any land use that could not be identified by a combination of any of the previous methods a windshield survey was conducted to identify the land use.]",
