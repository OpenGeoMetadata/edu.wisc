"dc_description_s": "This point data layer represents buildings for Manitowoc County, WI 2016.[The Manitowoc County lidar project area covers approximately 602 square miles plus a 100 meter buffer around the county boundary. The lidar data was acquired at a nominal point spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters and a single swath nominal point density (NPD) of 2.0. Project specifications are based on Manitowoc County requirements and on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program LiDAR Base Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of Coordinate System: The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD_1983(2011)_WISCRS_Manitowoc_County_Feet (EPSG code: 7614), and vertical datum of NAVD88 - Geoid12A (Feet). LiDAR data was acquired using the Orion Optech H300 sensor from November 2, 2015 to November 10, 2015 in five total lifts. Acquisition occurred after leaves had fallen from deciduous trees, before snow was on the ground, and with rivers at or below normal levels.]",

"uw_supplemental_s": "Augmented original metadata with UW-Madison specific elements. [The lidar data produced for this project was used to generate 2D building outlines for County applications. The classified building roof points (Class 6) are processed through modeling software which employs edge-detection macros to determine the outside extents of buildings. A degree of manual and automated editing was performed to clean up areas where dense vegetation partially obscures buildings. The 2014 orthoimagery was used to perform QC of the building outlines. Limitations â€“ The building classification was performed on structures that are 10-ft or taller to eliminate the inclusion of dumpsters, semi-trailers, small sheds, and other non-permanent infrastructure that was captured in the point cloud. Structures under 10-ft in height are not represented in the building outline dataset. In areas where dense vegetation completely overhangs small buildings, the classification procedure may have correctly classified points as vegetation. Buildings do not exist in the building dataset where the overhanging vegetation is classified as vegetation in the point cloud.]",
