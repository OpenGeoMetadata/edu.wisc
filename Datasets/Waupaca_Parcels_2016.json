The features included in the geodatabase are 'FARMLAND', 'FLOODPLAIN', 'GENERAL', and 'SHORELAND'. [Tax parcel map of Waupaca County, Wisconsin. The layer was derived from a variety of source maps including: mylar county parcel maps, plats of surveys, deed descriptions, subdivision maps, certified survey maps, highway right-of-way plats, and township highway right-of-way maps. These source materials were of several different scales and were from dates ranging from the early 1850's to the present.

It is not, however, meant to be used for the determination of land ownership or to be in any way a substitute for the land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds. The tax parcel layer is available in a county-wide or individual layer for each township, city, or village. The current publication date is January, 1 2016. These parcels represent land ownership from January 1st, 2015 - December 31st, 2015. This data coincides with the 2015 Real Estate Tax Roll.]",
