"dc_description_s": "This data represents trout habitat project points for Wisconsin in 2021. [The layer represents Wisconsin DNR trout habitat management project points. Trout habitat management projects include activities such as maintaining trout streams, improving existing streams and restoring streams capable of sustaining trout populations. Projects are managed through the Inland Trout Program which is funded through the Inland Waters Trout Stamp Program revenues, sales of patron licenses and collector stamps, general fishing license fees, federal Sport Fishing Restoration (SFR) funding and donations. For more information about the Inland Trout Program please visit https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/fishing/trout/InlandManagement.html Trout Habitat Projects are represented by points or lines depending on the level of detail of geographic reporting for a given project. Projects represented as lines represent the full extent of the project along the stream while projects represented by points are either site specific projects or represent the starting location of project.]",
