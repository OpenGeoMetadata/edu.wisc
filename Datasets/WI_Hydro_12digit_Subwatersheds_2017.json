This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the 'FGDC Proposal, Version 1.0 - Federal Standards For Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries 3/01/02' (http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/huc_data.html). These polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, 6th level subwatersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, non-contributing areas and flow modification. The native projection of Watershed Boundary Dataset was UTM zone 16T. This data has been projected to the Wisconsin Transverse Mercator (WTM) coordinate system for use in DNR applications. The dataset extent is the state of Wisconsin, plus the extent of 8-digit HUCs that extend across the state line into adjacent states.", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "CBE9653B-9FCF-45DB-A0B0-02CAD269B7BC", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "layer_modified_dt": "", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide", "Wisconsin State Agencies"], "dc_creator_sm": ["Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Inland Waters"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2017"], "solr_year_i": 2017, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_Hydro_12digit_Subwatersheds_2017.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hydrologic-units-12-digit-subwatersheds\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_Hydro_12digit_Subwatersheds_2017.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-93.368122, -86.80504, 48.014402, 41.308488)", "uw_supplemental_s": "", "uw_notice_s": ""}
