[This dataset includes the following information: Objectid from CurrentYearsTaxableParcels.TaxRollParcels Attribute from CurrentYearsTaxableParcels.TaxRollParcels Acres from CurrentYearsTaxableParcels.TaxRollParcels UniqueId – created so each record has a uniqueid from attribute and polyid ParcelType from CurrentYearsTaxableParcels.TaxRollParcels Shape from CurrentYearsTaxableParcels.TaxRollParcels Internalid from Taxrollxref GeneralTax_LandValue – this is a summary of land values for the property where the assessment class is G1 – G7 GeneralTax_ImprovementValue – this is a summary of improvement values for the property where the assessment class is G1 – G7 GeneralTax_Acreage – this is a summary of acres for the property where the assessment class is G1 – G7 ForestCropAcreage – this is a summary of acres for the property where the assessment class is W1 – W9 ExemptAcreage – this is a summary of acres for the property where the assessment class is X1 – X4 Please note: Since the TaxRollParcels feature class has not been dissolved if a parcel is divided by a road or other land, the valuation is put on both map objects which could cause the total assessment values associated to the county to be inflated. A dissolve based on the internalid should be run to resolve this problem.]",
