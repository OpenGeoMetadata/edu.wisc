 "dc_description_s": "This data represents LiDAR-derived classified LAS points for 5 counties that are a part of the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC): Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Walworth, Washington, and Waukesha counties, Wisconsin in 2015. Point classification uses semi-automated techniques on the point cloud to assign the feature type associated with each point. LiDAR points can be classified into a number of categories including bare earth or ground, top of canopy, and water. The different classes are defined using numeric integer codes in the LAS files.",
