"dc_description_s": "This land classification layer was derived from 2013 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) images. It classifies land within all municipal boundaries and Census-defined urban areas into one of five categories: (1)tree/shrub, (2)grass/herbaceous, (4)water, (7)impervious surface or (9)wetland. The classification was pursued for municipal and urban areas as well as a 1-km buffer around those locations. The original process classified land into three types, but then water and wetland areas were masked out using polygons provided by the DNR. Pixel size is 1-m2.",
