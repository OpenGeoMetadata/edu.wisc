It is a statewide integration of county-level address data submitted during the V4 DOA-WI Land Information Program call for public data in 2018. [The data has been re-projected and the attributes have been standardized. Site address information and coordinates were kept from the original county data datasets (X, Y field values are from the counties). If site information was not included with the address point, site address was captured with V4 parcels. All data was standardized, geocoded and parsed into separate address fields (Latitude, Longitude field values are from geocoding). Data from the Fall 2018 Municipal Wards collection was also added to this dataset.]", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "0D40B710-5AFD-4F0B-9368-4F7BB787EDBD", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "layer_modified_dt": "", "dc_format_s": "Geodatabase", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide", "Wisconsin State Agencies"], "dc_creator_sm": ["Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Location"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2018"], "solr_year_i": 2018, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_Addresses_2018.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"http://ltsb.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=481b153199624af492977e7e6aab76ad\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_Addresses_2018.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-92.889337, -86.763988, 47.080713, 42.49193)", "uw_supplemental_s": "", "uw_notice_s": ""}
