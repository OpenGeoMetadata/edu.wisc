Areas mapped include all rural areas, unincorporated municipalities, incorporated muinicipalities in La Crosse County. La Crosse County utilized numerous source documents and materials during the construction of the taxparcels GIS database. These documents were Certified Survey Maps, recorded plats, stateplane coordinates, section data and the taxdata system to map the taxparcels. Spatial (positional) accuracy ranges in value depending on the source data. Areas lacking monumentation and/or survey records may not be accurate. This mapping provides a useful representation of the geometry and topology of taxparcels. It is not meant to be used for the determination of land ownership or be in any way a substitute for a land survey.]",
