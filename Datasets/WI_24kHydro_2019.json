For WD_HYDRO_FLOWLINE_LN_24K: [Flowlines include all line features from the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams etc. A large portion of the WDNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been added to the linework along with officially recognized water body names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Flowlines were created with M (measures) values to accommodate placement of user data through a linear referencing system.]For WD_HYDRO_JUNCTION_PT_24K: [Hydro Junction was derived from the Hydro ArcInfo Node coverage. These features are used to establish point attributes on a network. The features act as sources and sinks in a geometric network. In conjuction with the Hydro Flowline feature class a full geometric network can be created. Additional attributes have been associated with these points to represent shoreline intersections, waterbody inputs / outputs, etc.]For WD_HYDRO_BANK_LN_24K: [Hydro Bank represents all the bank lines including complete Great Lake shorelines. Features were collected from water areas represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, reservoirs etc. A large portion of the DNR's unique IDs for waterbodies (Waterbody Identification Codes - WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). WaterBody WBIC will be related to its corresponding banks by attribute Waterbody_HydroID.]For WD_HYDRO_FLOWLINE_WBIC_LN_24K: [Flowlines include all line features from the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams etc. A large portion of the WDNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been added to the linework along with officially recognized water body names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database. Flowlines were created with M (measures) values to accommodate placement of user data through a linear referencing system.]For WD_HYDRO_LINE_LN_24K: [Lines features that include line features that do not transport water and are not banks or artificial banks from the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as channel in water and original water course, fish hatchery walls, etc, many of which serve strictly cartographic purposes. A large portion of the WDNR's Waterbody Identification Codes (WBICs) have been added to the linework along with officially recognized water body names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database.]For WD_HYDRO_WATERBODY_AR_24K: [Water areas are hydrographic features only and do not represent islands or uplands. Features were collected from water areas represented on the US Geological Survey's 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, reservoirs etc. A large portion of the DNR's unique IDs for waterbodies (Waterbody Identification Codes - WBICs) have been incorporated into the 24K Hydro layer, along with surface water names from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).
