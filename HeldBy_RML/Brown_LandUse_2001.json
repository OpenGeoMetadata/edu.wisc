"dc_description_s": "This data represents land use for Brown County, Wisconsin in 2001. [The land use 2001 was inventoried by the Brown County/City of Green Gay Planning Department during the summer of 2001. Bay Lake Regional Planning also helped with the land use inventory. The LandUse2001 should only be used for historic land use analysis only and should not be updated by anyone. Special attention should be considered when comparing the 2000 air photo and 2001 existing land use GIS information. The land use2001 lacks the quality because of the lack of coordination during the land use inventory project. Thus, potential land use error is possible of this dataset.]",
