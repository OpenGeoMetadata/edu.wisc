"dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents tax parcels for St. Croix County, Wisconsin in 2007.[The tax parcel layer in St. Croix County was developed from numerous sources of base information including WDNR LandNet, Scanned Registered/Rectified tax parcel map sheets, digital half section mapping, and USGS DOQQ's . These various documents were brought together to create tax parcels, easements, road right-of-ways, and other graphic features that support tax parcel map generation. This map provides a useful representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels and is suitable for its intended purpose. It is not, however, meant to be used for the determination of land ownership or to be in any way a substitute for the land ownership and interest descriptions contained in individual deeds.]",
