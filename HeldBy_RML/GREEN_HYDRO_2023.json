Some feature digitization is from unknown source. Many features were digitized by the County on 2017 WROC photo background or 2011 Ayres LiDAR background. All features have been inspected by the County at a scale of 1:5000 or better. Only the largest lakes are populated for name field (although most features would not have a geographic name).]",
