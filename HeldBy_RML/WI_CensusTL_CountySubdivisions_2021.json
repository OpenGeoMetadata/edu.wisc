[The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data. They include legally-recognized minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories. MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statistical unorganized territories to complete coverage. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas are covered by county subdivisions. The boundaries of legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2020 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all CCDs, delineated in 21 states, are those as reported as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2020 Census.]", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "58FBF7E3-BD84-48D8-B2F6-0B1A89B67E43", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide"], "dc_creator_sm": ["U.S. Census Bureau"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Boundaries"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2021"], "solr_year_i": 2021, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_CensusTL_CountySubdivisions_2021.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files.html\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_CensusTL_CountySubdivisions_2021.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-92.889433, -86.249548, 47.309822, 42.49172)", "uw_supplemental_s": "This is an archived copy of the data held at UW-Madison.", "uw_notice_s": "", "layer_modified_dt": "2024-01-18T02:30:59Z"}
