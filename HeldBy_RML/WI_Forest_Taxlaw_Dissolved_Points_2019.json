	"dc_description_s": "Wisconsin’s forest tax laws encourage sustainable forest management on private lands by providing a property tax incentive to landowners. Both the Managed Forest Law (MFL) and Forest Crop Law (FCL) encourage proper management of woodlands not only in their purposes and policies, but through a written management plan for a landowner’s property. The management plan incorporates landowner objectives, timber management, wildlife management, water quality and the environment as a whole to create healthy and productive forest. In exchange for following a written management plan and program rules, landowners pay forest tax law program rates in lieu of regular property taxes.FCL lands are open to the public for the following activities: hunting and fishingMFL lands enrolled as open are open to the public for the following activities: hunting, fishing, hiking, sight-seeing, and cross-country skiing.Additional rules regarding public access may be reviewed here: http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/ForestLandowners/mfl.asp?s1=FTax&s2=OpenLandsOpen Private Forest Lands (OPFL) Project Background:Provide a simple GIS web mapping application to display the approximate representations of over 1.3 million acres of Forest Tax Law lands (Managed Forest and Forest Crop Law) open to the public for hunting, hiking, fishing, cross-country skiing, and sightseeing. Display information to allow the public to access the lands without spending a lot of time cross checking plat books or contacting local county offices or the county Land Information Offices.",
