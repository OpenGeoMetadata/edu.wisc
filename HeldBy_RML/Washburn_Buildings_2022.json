Features contained in the data set include all building or primary structure points countywide and associated attributes. Building points sometimes are referred to as primary structures, however these data typically represent the main building(s) that have been addressed on each parcel. The Washburn County Land Information Office plans to maintain this digital data in ESRI's ArcGIS 10.x geodatabase environment using ArcMap tools. Data was developed using field data collection techniques, Aerial Imagery and building footprints. Site access points are always present as a related feature class, however not all site access points are accompanied by a building point.]",
