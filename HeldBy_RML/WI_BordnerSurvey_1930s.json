"dc_description_s": "These maps give insight to what the landscape of Wisconsin looked like at a time of peak deforestation and land abandonment in addition to how this legacy has impacted the current landscape. Furthermore, these maps offer a tool for future landscape management including but not limited to: shore line changes, erosion, reforestation, and wetland restoration. Included in this geodatabase are: economic natural features (points); land use-land cover (polygons); transportation water infrastructure (lines). At present, Bordner polygon data is available for the entire state, with the exception of Milwaukee and Menominee Counties, which were never surveyed. Point and line data exist for selected areas of the state. Digitizing of these features is not yet complete .A user guide for this data may be found here: https://maps.sco.wisc.edu/bordner/about/",
