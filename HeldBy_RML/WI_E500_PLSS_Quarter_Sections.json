"dc_description_s": "The E5 PLSS database, part of a multi-year effort, was created as a sub-project of the greater Version 9 Statewide Parcel Map Database Project (V9 Project), a collaboration between the Wisconsin Land Information Program, the State Cartographerâ€™s Office, and county data contributors. More information about the Statewide Parcel Map Initiative can be found here.The E5 database contains a collection of all uniquely identifiable local-level PLSS data available in digital format, and aggregates that data into a standardized schema and format. It also includes section, quarter-section, and quarter-quarter-section level polygons. The construction of the PLSS corner locations contained within the database relies on the local level coordinate information. This unique aspect of the database, allows for an accurate representation of the on-the-ground location of the PLSS corners.The quarter-section and quarter-quarter-section polygon boundaries and the points on which they are based were subdivided by protraction and based on protracted points. These section subdivisions should be used only for mapping and reference purposes and are not representative of actual surveyed quarter sections or quarter-quarter sections.Please complete the feedback survey form.Schema documentation can be found here.",
