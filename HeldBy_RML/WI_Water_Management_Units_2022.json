[Wisconsin's Water Management Units data layer contains 24 delineated basins created initially for the Priority Watershed Program. Basins and watersheds are interconnected areas of land draining from surrounding ridge tops to a common point such as a lake or confluence with a neighboring land area. These basins, delineated by DNR, generally indicate areas that drain into a common river system or lake, but may also be based on DNR basin management criteria.]",
