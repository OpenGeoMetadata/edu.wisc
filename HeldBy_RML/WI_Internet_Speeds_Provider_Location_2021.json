"dc_description_s": "This data represents internet speed tests by provider and location for Wisconsin in 2021. [These data are a subset of data collected through the Measurement Lab (M-Lab) broadband speed test. These data were collected as part of DPI's broadband speed testing initiative using M-Lab's Network Diagnostic speed test tool (NDT). You can learn more about the NDT speed test tool and DPI's speed testing initiative on the Broadband Speed Test page. The data presented were collected via the Measurement Lab (M-Lab) Network Diagnostic speed test tool (NDT). The tool is a single stream performance measurement of a connection’s capacity for “bulk transport” as defined in IETF’s RFC 3148. NDT measures “single stream performance” or “bulk transport capacity”. It measures speeds at the points in networks where a user connects to the Internet rather than within a user location. The data used for these maps was extracted from the M-Lab database using BigQuery. Details about the data tools can be found here. A more complete explanation of the M-Lab data can be found here. More notes about the data: The M-Lab data was pre-filtered to only show home internet providers. Locations do not show specific locations where the speed tests were conducted. Data is summarized by location and internet service provider. The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction encouraged public school districts to have their students take the speed tests in their primary residence during early 2021.]",
