"dc_description_s": "The Wisconsin State Cartographer's Office (SCO) and the Arthur H. Robinson Map Library (RML) at the University of Wisconsin have collaborated to create an online point index that represents digital aerial photographs available for download from the Wisconsin Historic Aerial Image Finder. Photography represented in the online index covers the years 1936 to present and comes from a variety of sources including federal agencies, regional consortia, and local governments. Detailed information is available at the image level for each center point that describes specific photo attributes. In addition to the digital archive represented by these data layers, the RML maintains a print archive of nearly 260,000 individual photographs dating from 1936 to the early-2000's. It is recommended that this large and detailed dataset be viewed directly in ArcGIS Online (link provided at the right, near the metadata link).",
