"dc_description_s": "This data represents zoning for Jackson County, Wisconsin in 2021 and includes the layers 'Jackson_City_2021' and 'Jackson_General_2021.'[This digital geospatial dataset represents parcel boundaries in Jackson County, Wisconsin, with data attributes standardized in accordance to those required for participation in the Wisconsin Statewide Parcel Map Database Project. The Wisconsin Statewide Parcel Map Database Project is administered by the Wisconsin Land Information Program with the purpose of creating a publicly available statewide parcel dataset and webmap. Wisconsin Act 20, the biennial state budget for 2013-2015, created statutory directives for state and local governments to coordinate on the development of a statewide digital parcel map. The Statewide Parcel Map Initiative is an effort to create a digital parcel map for Wisconsin by aggregating local parcel datasets utilizing geographic information systems (GIS) technology. The Parcel Initiative is a multi-faceted, multi-year collaborative effort of the Department of Administration, State Cartographer's Office, and local governments. The Wisconsin Land Information Program (WLIP), administered by the Division of Intergovernmental Relations within the Department of Administration (DOA), provides over $13 million annually in public funding to Wisconsin counties for the modernization of local land records. This funding takes the form of register of deeds real estate document recording fees retained at the county level and grants awarded by DOA. Strategic Initiative Grant funding provided to Jackson County is utilized to maintain this digital parcel dataset, as well as improve its overall accuracy.]",
