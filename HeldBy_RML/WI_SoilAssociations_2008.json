This layer includes data about soil associations. By definition, a soil association is a landscape that has a distinctive proportional pattern of soils; it normally consists of one or more major soils and at least one minor soil, and is named for the major soil. The soil associations layer was digitized from the 1:250,000-scale compilation sheets of a 1968 soils map of Wisconsin (Hole et. al). The soil associations in this coverage were subsequently grouped into 4 'soil characteristics' categories in the layer 'WI_SoilCharacteristics_2008'/'schppoly', for use in the GCSM. For the purposes of the GCSM, soil depth was considered to extend from the land surface to 5 feet below the land surface.",
