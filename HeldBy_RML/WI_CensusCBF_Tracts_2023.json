"dc_description_s": "This data represents Census Tracts from the U.S. Census Bureau for Wisconsin in 2023. [The cartographic boundary files are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureauâ€™s Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) System. These boundary files are specifically designed for small scale thematic mapping.When possible, generalization is performed with intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year.To improve the appearance of shapes, areas are represented with fewer vertices than detailed TIGER/Line equivalents. Some small holes or discontiguous parts of areas are not included in generalized files.Generalized boundary files are clipped to a simplified version of the U.S. outline. As a result, some offshore areas may be excluded from the generalized files.]",
