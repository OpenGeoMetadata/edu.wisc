"dc_description_s": "This data represents boundaries for Cooperative Educational Service Agencies within the state of Wisconsin at year's end in 2022. [Cooperative Educational Service Agencies are intermediate service agencies that provide programs, services, and resources to a region of school districts in the state of Wisconsin. This dataset was assembled using county-derived school district boundary data and school district information from the Department of Public Instruction website. Each year, there is a chance for reorganizations to take place that either transfer territory between school districts or consolidate/dissolve/create districts. These reorganizations go into effect on July 1st of each year. Sometimes reorganizations involve CESA boundaries as territory transfers between school districts located in two different CESAs. In 2020, there were no reorganizations that caused changes to CESA boundaries, however, the boundaries were updated to better reflect the boundaries of the unified and secondary school district boundary layers from which this layer is derived. See lineage section for more information on this update.]",
