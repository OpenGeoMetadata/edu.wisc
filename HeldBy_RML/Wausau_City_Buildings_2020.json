"dc_description_s": "This data represents building footprints in the City of Wausau, Wisconsin in 2020.[The planimetric data provided to the City of Wausau by Ayres Associates serves as the foundation for spatial analysis for municipal departments. The stereoimagery that the planimetric mapping was created from was flown at 3 inch GSD. Project specifications are based on City of Wausau requirements. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83(2011) / WISCRS Marathon (ftUS) (EPSG Code: 7618). Imagery was acquired on April 26, 2020 in 1 total lift. Acquisition occurred with leaves absent from deciduous trees, when no snow was present on the ground, and with rivers at or below normal levels.All feature classes that contain unique subtypes also contain an 'Unknown' subtype. However, this subtype is only used regularly in the PavedArea_POLY for paved areas that are not either a Pier dock, or Runway.]",
