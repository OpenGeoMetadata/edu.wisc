	"dc_description_s": "Wiscland 2 is a raster representation of the land cover throughout the state of Wisconsin as of 2016. The dataset is primarily derived from remote sensing imagery acquired by the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellites between 2010 and 2014. Land cover was classified via supervised classification at the native 30 m resolution. The map has a two acre minimum mapping unit, meaning that the smallest feature depicted in the map is approximately nine pixels in size. The land cover data are best utilized at approximate map scales of 1:48,000 to 1:500,000, and at no less than a 2 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU). Overall accuracy for the Level 2 classification is estimated at 86% across all classes. For estimates of class and regional accuracy, and detailed information on the map production, classification scheme, and class descriptions, see the Wiscland 2 User Guide (ftp://dnrftp01.wi.gov/geodata/metadata/WI_land_cover2_user_guide.pdf)",
