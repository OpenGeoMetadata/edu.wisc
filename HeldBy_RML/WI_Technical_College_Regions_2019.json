	"dc_description_s": "This dataset includes boundaries for the Wisconsin Technical College System regions. This layer was created using unified and secondary public school district boundaries for the state of Wisconsin. Authoritative information used to create this dataset came from the Wisconsin Technical College board policy manualwhich was current as of December 2017 and last updated in November 2012.Each year, there is a chance for reorganizations to take place that either transfer territory between school districts or consolidate/dissolve/create districts. These reorganizations go into effect on July 1st of each year. Changes in school district boundaries have the potential to affect technical college boundaries. In 2019, three reorganizations required changes to the technical college boundaries when two pieces of territory were swapped between River Valley (Madison Area) and Dodgeville (Southwest Wisconsin) school districts and territory was transferred from Hudson school district (Wisconsin Indianhead) to River Falls school district (Chippewa Valley).",
