"dc_description_s": "This data represents wetland indicators for Wisconsin State in 2022. [This layer describes the most likely hydric indicators of Wisconsin using a Compound Topographic Index (CTI) based on a 10m cell size to look for areas of a landscape that could collect water. These areas are then compared against the Hydric Soils and the Non-Hydric Soils as provided by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to extract those areas of the landscape that not already classified as hydric or partially hydric by the NRCS. Mapped hydric soils are typically found within areas designated as wetlands, so intersecting soils information and landscape position can identify potential wetlands. The 'tiger-striping/terracing' that occurs in the layer is the result of the DEM creation. Any area between the stripes should be assumed to be a part of the wet area. For more information on the mapped soil types, please use the Identify tool and link to the NRCS Web Soil Survey.]",
