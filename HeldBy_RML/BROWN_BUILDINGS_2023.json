[This map layer (feature class) depicts the approximate position, size and shape of built structures. Buildings were collected from various sources and years; Check the building feature attribute for source and vintage. Razed buildings are deleted from this layer as time allows. Building feature attribute 'PRIMARY' indicates a structure is believed to be often occupied by humans or frequently serves as a human gathering place (residences, businesses, schools, churches, etc); 'SECONDARY' building attributes indicate the structure is believed to be mostly uninhabited by humans (secondary structures include barns, garages, storage sheds, etc). This map layer is updated by Brown County only on occasion as new data sources become available and as time permits.]",
