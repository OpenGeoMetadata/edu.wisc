"dc_description_s": "This dataset contains culvert data points and associated attributes from a variety of sources, primarily focusing on the Lake Superior shore of Wisconsin. The WICDI (WI Coastal-Management Data Infrastructure) project sought to collect and compile available culvert data to create a single point of access for coastal and culvert managers. Existing culvert datasets were integrated using a consistent schema to facilitate ease of use. This dataset is the result of this data collection and integration process. The project was funded by the Wisconsin Coastal Management Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office for Coastal Management under the Coastal Zone Management Act, Grant # NA18NOS4190087 and Grant # NA20NOS4190105.",
