"dc_description_s": "This data represents Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) site points for Wisconsin State in 2022. [Point representation of EPAâ€™s list of contaminated sites, the National Priorities List (NPL), where potentially responsible parties pay for the cleanup or where EPA uses government funds. Also includes sites proposed for and deleted from the NPL, as well as Superfund Alternative Sites which are eligible for the NPL but are instead covered by an agreement for NPL-equivalent standards. Due to newer state cleanup programs, Wisconsin now adds few sites to the NPL. Data does not include: Hazardous substance (i.e., locations where a cleanup confirmed by laboratory analysis is generally completed within 60 to 90 days) Some recent sites that are not yet mapped. Some sites with soil contamination above chapter NR 720 residual contaminant levels for cleanups approved prior to August 1, 2002. Locations where a discharge or potential discharge was reported to the DNR and the DNR determined that no investigation is required. Sites never reported to the DNR. To view more contamination data layers see the RR Sites Map at https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Brownfields/rrsm.html, or for specific site information search BRRTS on the Web at https://dnr.wi.gov/botw/SetUpBasicSearchForm.do.]",
