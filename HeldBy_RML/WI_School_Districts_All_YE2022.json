"dc_description_s": "This data represents boundaries for all school districts for Wisconsin state at year's end in 2022. [This dataset includes boundaries for all school district boundaries within the state of Wisconsin. By law, all territory in the state must be included within a public school district. The US Census Bureau identifies three types of school districts. Unified school districts serve children of all grade levels, Elementary primarily serve students in the elementary grades, and Secondary primarily serve children in grades 9-12. Out of 421 school districts in Wisconsin, 43 are considered elementary districts, 10 are secondary districts, and 368 are unified districts. Elementary and secondary school districts overlap.This layer is an aggregate of county-submitted data for school district boundaries.This is not an official authoritative statewide dataset for unified school district boundaries nor does one exist for Wisconsin. The boundaries reflect tax parcel data submitted by Wisconsin counties in January of each year. These boundaries are updated annually around July 1 to reflect boundary changes from the reorganization process and as needed throughout the rest of the year.]",
