"dc_description_s": "This data represents internet download speed tests by location for Wisconsin in 2021. [The data presented were collected via the Measurement Lab's (M-Lab) Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT), during the time period of January 1, 2020 and May 12, 2021. The speed test tool is a single stream performance measurement of a connection’s capacity for “bulk transport” as defined in IETF’s RFC 3148. NDT measures “single stream performance” or “bulk transport capacity”. It measures speeds at the points in networks where a user connects to the Internet rather than within a user location. The data used for these maps were extracted from the M-Lab database using BigQuery and have been filtered to only contain results that used the ndt7 testing protocol. Speed test data is summarized by location over the entire time period expressed above, regardless of home Internet Service Provider. The data are symbolized to show median download speeds in three categories: LOW (0 - 6 Mbps), MEDIUM (6 - 18 Mbps), and HIGH (higher than18 Mbps).]",
