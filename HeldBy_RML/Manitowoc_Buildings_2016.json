"dc_description_s": "This point data layer represents buildings for Manitowoc County, WI 2016.[The Manitowoc County lidar project area covers approximately 602 square miles plus a 100 meter buffer around the county boundary. The lidar data was acquired at a nominal point spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters and a single swath nominal point density (NPD) of 2.0. Project specifications are based on Manitowoc County requirements and on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program LiDAR Base Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of Coordinate System: The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD_1983(2011)_WISCRS_Manitowoc_County_Feet (EPSG code: 7614), and vertical datum of NAVD88 - Geoid12A (Feet). LiDAR data was acquired using the Orion Optech H300 sensor from November 2, 2015 to November 10, 2015 in five total lifts. Acquisition occurred after leaves had fallen from deciduous trees, before snow was on the ground, and with rivers at or below normal levels.]",
