"dc_description_s": "This raster dataset contains a simplified version of the historical downscaled climate data produced by the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts' (WICCI) Climate Working Group. This dataset contains several precipitation metrics averaged by month across the 30-year period from 1981-2010. These metrics include average total monthly precipitation and inter-model standard deviation for total monthly precipitation precipitation. In addition, the data includes the estimated number of days per month that meet commonly used thresholds: the days where the precipitation exceeds 1, 2, or 3 inches and days with no precipitation. The spatial resolution of the data is 0.1 x 0.1 degrees (approximately 6x6 miles on the ground). This historical climate data is a subset of the downscaling 'de-biasing' process where the 1950-2005 time period in the climate model is matched to the 1950-2009 in the observed station record. The slight mismatch in the climate and observed time period has negligible impact because climate change operates slowly over decades. Instead, it is more important that the climate record is long enough to 'average out' natural climate variability. More details about the original data this is derived from can be found at https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-uwpd-cmip5/ and the WICCI's two climate assessment reports from 2011 and 2021 (available at https://wicci.wisc.edu/). The python code used to produce this simplified version is available at https://github.com/TheGeographer/DownscaledClimateData. A how-to video on using this data is available from GeoData@Wisconsin: https://geodata.wisc.edu/pages/videos.",
