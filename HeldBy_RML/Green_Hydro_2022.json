"dc_description_s": "This data represents hydrography for Green County, Wisconsin in 2022 and includes the layers 'Green_Hydro_2022_LINE' and 'Green_Hydro_2022_POLY.' [LINE: Perennial streams (rivers) as defined by previous version of this feature class with few exceptions (where a correction was necessitated). River flowlines are not 'planarized' and are full length. River 'spurs' are planarized. Spurs are not populated for name field (although most would not have a geographic name). Features are designed for display with the 'water_inter' feature class (they align). Many of these rivers were digitized by the County on 2017 WROC photo background or 2011 Ayres LiDAR background. However, the majority of the digitization in this feature class is from/by an unknown source. All features have been inspected by the County at a scale of 1:5000 or better. POLY: Includes small ponds, which in some cases may be intermittent. Also includes oxbows. Some feature digitization is from unknown source. Many features were digitized by the County on 2017 WROC photo background or 2011 Ayres LiDAR background. All features have been inspected by the County at a scale of 1:5000 or better. Only the largest lakes are populated for name field (although most features would not have a geographic name).]",
