"dc_description_s": "These data layers represent hydrography for Marinette County, Wisconsin in 2016. It is a feature class within the geodatabase 'Marinette_Hydro_2016.gdb'. The feature layers included in this geodatabase are 'Marinette_HydroLine_2016' and 'Marinette_HydroPoly_2016'.[The HydroPoly_2016 shapefile represents the lakes, ponds, rivers and streams in Marinette County, Wisconsin. Data is referenced to the Marinette County Coordinate System, North American Datum 1983 with the 1991 adjustment (NAD83/91).The original source data, Wisconsin DNR 24K Hydrography (Version 1), was obtained from the WIDNR as a shapefile referenced to WTM 83-91. The shapefile was then projected to the Marinette County Coordinate System. At this point, the attribute table was modified and changed to the current configuration. Features were combined using the WBIC as the unique identifier. Using acquired Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQ's) as a backdrop, the alignment of the waterbodies were modified (heads up digitized) to correspond to the DOQ's and updated using WROC orthoa (2010 and 2015) and 2015 FEMA LiDar data. (DOQ horizontal position accuracy reported to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) for 1:12,000 scale products.) Topology between HydroArc and HydroPoly will exist after all editing is complete. As with all public information derived from variable sources, this data may contain errors or faults. Therefore, Marinette County does not provide any warranty, express or implied, that this data is absolutely accurate.
