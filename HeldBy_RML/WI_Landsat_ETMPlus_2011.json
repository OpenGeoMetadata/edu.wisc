	"dc_description_s": "This image is a mosaic of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) pan sharpened imagery, covering Wisconsin and parts of adjoining states. The image resolution is 14.25 meters by 14.25 meters. The image has been projected to Wisconsin Transverse Mercator (see http://dnr.wi.gov/maps/gis/wtm8391.html). The Tri-Decadal Global Landsat Orthorectified ETM+ Pan Mosaic browse images are displayed as a 7,4,2 (RGB) color composite. (Note that when loaded into ArcView, these are labelled Bands 1,2,3.) The mosaic covers a 5 degree (north-south) segment of a standard 6 degree wide (east-west) UTM zone. It is further subdivided into four 2.5 degree by 3 degree quadrants. The original browse images were generated from full-resolution data that is orthorectified and UTM-projected, using the World Geodetic System 1984 datum. Full-resolution data may be downloaded from the USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis) at no charge: http://glovis.usgs.gov/AboutBrowse.shtml .",
