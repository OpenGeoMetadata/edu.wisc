"dc_description_s": "This resource is a member of a series. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of select geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) System (MTS). The MTS represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts; however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent dataset or can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one block group, and are uniquely numbered within census tracts. Block groups have a valid code range of 0 through 9. They also have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, tabulation blocks numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within block group 3 within that census tract. Block groups coded 0 are intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. A block group usually covers a contiguous area but never crosses county or census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. The block group boundaries in this release are those that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2025 Census.",
