"dc_description_s": "This data represents Bike LTS Scores for the City of Madison, Wisconsin in 2023. [LTS 1: Paths and streets with 1 lane per direction, speed limits ≤ 20 mph, and low traffic volumes, or up to 25 mph with bike lanes.LTS 2: Streets with 1 lane per direction, speed limits ≤ 30 mph, and low traffic volumes and/or bike lanes.LTS 3: Streets with 1-2 lanes per direction, speed limits ≤ 35 mph, and moderate traffic volumes and/or bike lanes.LTS 4: Streets with 2+ lanes per direction, with high speed limits and/or high traffic volumes.The LTS score for an intersection approach is based on the intersection configuration. Specifically, the score is based on whether there is a right-turn only lane and, if so, whether there is a “pocket” bike lane to the left of the right-turn lane and other details related to the design of these lanes and the curb radius of the intersection.Description of LTS levels for Intersection ApproachesNo effect: Simple intersection with no right-turn lane, or a single right turn lane of less than 75 feet with slow turning speeds.LTS 2: Intersection with a single right-turn lane of less than 150 feet and a bike lane that continues straight.LTS 3: Intersection with a right-turn lane of 75-150 feet and no bike lane, a bike lane that shifts to the left across a right-turn lane with slow turning speeds, or a bike lane that continues straight alongside a turn lane of more than 150 feet.LTS 4: Other intersection configurations, including multiple right-turn lanes and/or higher turning speeds.The LTS score for an unsignalized intersection crossing is based on the number of travel lanes per direction on the intersecting street to be crossed, the presence of a median (for multi-lane streets), and the speed limit on the intersecting street.Description of LTS Levels for Intersection CrossingsUnsignalized CrossingsLTS 1: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit ≤ 30 mph.LTS 2: Intersecting street has only 1 lane per travel direction and speed limit ≤ 35 mph or 2 lanes but speed limit ≤ 30 mph.LTS 3: Intersecting street has 1 lane per travel direction and a speed limit of 40+ mph, or 2 lanes and a speed limit of 35 mph.LTS 4: Intersecting street has 2 lanes per travel direction and 40+ mph speed limit, or 3+ lanes.In some cases, intersection crossing LTS is reduced below these levels if the intersecting street is one-way only or is equipped with a median refuge.Signalized CrossingsCrossing streets at signalized intersections does not present a significant barrier for bicyclists and thus does not affect the LTS score unless a right turn lane is present.LTS_F (LTS_F) Final Bike LTS (Level of Traffic Stress) score.]",
