To be used by Green County Sheriff's Dispatcher's through their third party E911 dispatching and reporting system created by Spillman Technologies. Data created in conjunction with State E911 update grant. Features were derived from a variety of sources including deeds, descriptions, subdivision maps, certified survey maps, easements, and right of way maps. These source materials were of varying scale and date. This coverage provides a representation of the geometry and topology of tax parcels within the County, and is suitable as a reference layer within the County's GIS. ROW: Road right of ways reflecting varying degree of accuracy/understanding. Some right of ways depicted are based on plats or plan-sets, and some are based on standard widths (and the presumption of 'grandfathered' right of way).]",
