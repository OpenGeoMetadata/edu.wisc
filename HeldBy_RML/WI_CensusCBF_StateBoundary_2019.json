[The 2019 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files. States and equivalent entities are the primary governmental divisions of the United States. In addition to the fifty states, the Census Bureau treats the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and each of the Island Areas (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) as the statistical equivalents of states for the purpose of data presentation.]", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "5692C1AE-B6DC-42C2-92C6-176ADBADFDF0", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide"], "dc_creator_sm": ["U.S. Census Bureau"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Boundaries"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2019"], "solr_year_i": 2019, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_CensusCBF_StateBoundary_2019.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files.html\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_CensusCBF_StateBoundary_2019.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-92.888114, -86.805415, 47.080621, 42.491983)", "uw_supplemental_s": "This is an archived copy of the data held at UW-Madison.", "uw_notice_s": "", "layer_modified_dt": "2024-01-18T02:30:59Z"}
