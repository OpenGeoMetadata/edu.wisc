This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created in accordance with the &quot;FGDC Proposal, Version 1.0 - Federal Standards For Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries 3/01/02&quot; (http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/huc_data.html). These polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes and names for 4th level sub-basins. The native projection of the Watershed Boundary Dataset was UTM zone 16T. This extract has been projected to the Wisconsin Transverse Mercator (WTM) coordinate system for use in DNR applications. The dataset extent is the state of Wisconsin, plus the extent of 8-digit HUCs that extend across the state line into adjacent states.", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "F3569FB4-A995-4DCF-8CE9-E3D9CE457A1A", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon","layer_modified_dt": "2022-01-22T20:12:43Z", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide", "Wisconsin State Agencies"], "dc_creator_sm": ["Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Inland Waters"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2017"], "solr_year_i": 2017, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_Hydro_8digit_Subbasins_2017.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_Hydro_8digit_Subbasins_2017.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-93.368122, -86.80504, 48.014402, 41.308488)", "uw_supplemental_s": "", "uw_notice_s": ""}
