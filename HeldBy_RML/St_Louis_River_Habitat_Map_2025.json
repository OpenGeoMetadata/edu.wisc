The methodology to produce the UNET map is described on the University of Minnesota U-Spatial GitHub repository: https://github.com/WIStCart/StLouisEstuary-HabitatMap Full descriptive metadata for this project is accessible via the 'habitat_map_raster' feature inside the geodatabase. Post-processing was implemented to produce a final habitat map and a change map from the UNET map. The methodology is described on the University of Wisconsin State Cartographerâ€™s Office GitHub repository: https://github.com/WIStCart/StLouisEstuary-HabitatMap The maps were produced under a project funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
