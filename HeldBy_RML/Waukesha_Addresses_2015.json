[The file was originally derived from the Addressing Maintenance System tabular database by joining it to the Tax Parcel feature class and creating a centroid. It was then updated to reflect the needs of E911 dispatch. Each address point is located on the main building of a parcel or the center of the parcel if no building exists. Mile Markers are posted at the locations of the actual signs. Non-addressed points (landmarks, points of interest, etc) are placed where deemed useful. The file also contains retired addresses that are no longer valid.]",
