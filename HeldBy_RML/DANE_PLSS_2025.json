[This dataset is a representation of the PLSS control across Dane County, Wisconsin. About 60% of the PLSS control is made up of the coordinates that were developed as part of the multi-year remonumentation project by Dane County. This work includes finding, restoring and / or replacing US-PLSS section corner monuments and collecting accurate coordinate data. As the project continues the new control will replace the older PLSS control and eventually have updated PLSS control countywide.]",
