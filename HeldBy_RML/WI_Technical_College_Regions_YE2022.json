[This dataset includes boundaries for the Wisconsin Technical College System regions. This layer was created using unified and secondary public school district boundaries for the state of Wisconsin. Authoritative information used to create this dataset came from the Wisconsin Technical College board policy manual which was current as of August 2021 and last updated in April 2020. Each year, there is a chance for reorganizations to take place that either transfer territory between school districts or consolidate/dissolve/create districts. These reorganizations go into effect on July 1st of each year. Changes in school district boundaries have the potential to affect technical college boundaries.]",
