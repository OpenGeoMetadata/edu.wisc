"dc_description_s": "This feature dataset comprises three hydrographic layers: Lakes, Dual Line Hydro (major rivers), and Flowlines (smaller streams and rivers). The dataset was developed for the 2025 Wisconsin State Highway Map and encompasses the entire state of Wisconsin, extending slightly beyond its boundaries. The original data was sourced from 1:24,000-scale hydro layers produced by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR). To meet the cartographic requirements of the highway map, which is at a scale of approximately 1:800,000, a systematic approach was employed to simplify and generalize the data. This involved selecting lakes and rivers of appropriate size and generalizing features to ensure clarity and readability at smaller scales. The dataset is also suitable for other small-scale cartographic purposes in depicting Wisconsinâ€™s hydrography.",
