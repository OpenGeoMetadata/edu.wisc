Projects represented as lines represent the full extent of the project along the stream while projects represented by points are either site specific projects or represent the starting location of project.]", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "UW-Madison Robinson Map Library", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "09BA7ACD-8BDE-474E-9951-4868F2E87310", "layer_geom_type_s": "Line", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Statewide", "Wisconsin State Agencies"], "dc_creator_sm": ["Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Biota"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2021"], "solr_year_i": 2021, "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/WI_Trout_Habitat_Project_Lines_2021.zip\",\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/trout-habitat-project-lines?geometry=-97.862%2C43.478%2C-82.448%2C46.204\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WI_Trout_Habitat_Project_Lines_2021.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-92.798577, -87.839511, 46.883732, 42.774973)", "uw_supplemental_s": "This is an archived copy of the data held at UW-Madison.
