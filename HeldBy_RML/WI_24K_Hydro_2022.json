"dc_description_s": "This data represents hydrography for Wisconsin, in 2022 and includes the layers 'WD_HYDRO_BANK_LN_24K', 'WD_HYDRO_FLOWLINE_LN_24K', 'WD_HYDRO_FLOWLINE_WBIC_LN_24K', 'WD_HYDRO_JUNCTION_PT_24K', 'WD_HYDRO_LINE_LN_24K', 'WD_HYDRO_POINT_PT_24K', 'WD_HYDRO_WATERBODY_AR_24K', and 'WD_HYDRO_WATERBODY_WBIC_AR_24K'[The DNR Hydrography database was developed statewide using several 1:24,000-scale sources. This data layer includes information about surface water features represented on the USGS 1:24,000-scale topographic map series such as perennial and intermittent streams, lakes, etc. Because the sources of the Hydrography data span many years and originate from several sources, the data may reflect areas of transition from one source to another. As a result, the water features as represented in the Hydrography data may not always match what you see on a particular USGS quad or Digital Raster Graphic (DRG).]",
