"dc_description_s": "This data represents building inventory for northern Ashland County, Wisconsin in 2022. [This feature class is the product of a pilot project conducted by the Wisconsin State Cartographer's Office to create a freely distributable inventory of buildings and their attributes to serve a variety of purposes including to improve flood damage predictions. The goal was to include attributes describing the building itself, not the building's occupancy or use. The primary source of such data in Wisconsin, assessor data, is, in most cases, not available in a usable format without non-trivial cost or distribution restrictions. As a result, this publicly available building footprint feature class has little building-specific data. The project was funded by the Wisconsin Coastal Management Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office for Coastal Management under the Coastal Zone Management Act, Grant #NA20NOS4190092.]",
