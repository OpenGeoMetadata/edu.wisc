[The hydrography coverage was created to represent rivers, water bodies and other hydrographic phenomena in Waupaca County. Hydrologic features were derived from the May 1994 flight with a flight height of 10,000 feet. The hydrologic feature layer is available in a county-wide or individual layer for each township, city, or village. The layer is based on the Waupaca County Coordinate System (WCCS).]",

The codes are based on 'Lake Shoreline Classification Study' by the Discovery Group, based out of Madison Wisconsin. Hardcopy of report is available from the Waupaca County Zoning Department. The spring of 1994 was a wet year, so the hydro layer contains many features that are no longer open water. The hydro layer also contains features that would be considered wetlands. Currently there is no code to differentiate between open water and wetland.]",
