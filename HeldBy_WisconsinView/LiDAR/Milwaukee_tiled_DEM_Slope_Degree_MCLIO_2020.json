 "dc_description_s": "This data represents a LiDAR-derived tiled Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (Slope Degree) for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin in 2020. A DEM represents the bare-Earth surface, removing all natural and built features. Slope is the steepness or the degree of incline of a surface. The slope for a particular location is computed as the maximum rate of change of elevation between that location and its surroundings. It can be expressed either in degrees or as a percentage.",
