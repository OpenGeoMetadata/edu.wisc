 "dc_description_s": "This data represents LiDAR-derived breaklines for 5 counties that are a part of the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (SEWRPC): Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Walworth, Washington, and Waukesha counties, Wisconsin in 2015. Hydro breaklines maintain the definition of water-related features in an elevation model. They are used to capture linear discontinuities in the surface, lake shorelines, single-line drains for small rivers, and double-line drains for large rivers.",
