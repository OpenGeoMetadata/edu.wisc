 "dc_description_s": "This data represents (calibrated) raw swath LAS files for Clark County, WI in 2018. Each flight line (swath) contains a series of raw point cloud files in LAS format. Swath areas of data collection are part of the raw data deliverable from a lidar acquisition project. Typically, no points are deleted from the raw swath collection, with a few exceptions for extraneous data such as outliers, blunders, noise points, or geometrically unreliable points near the extreme edge of the swath.",
