 "dc_description_s": "This data represents buildings (3-D) for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) in 2021. [3-D Building Models representing every building in Milwaukee County, WI present in the 2020 lidar survey. Models are based a standardized feature extraction algorithm using esri software. There are roughly 3 levels of detail present in the dataset: Level of Detail (LOD) 1 (simple/prismatic buildings with flat roof detail), LOD 2 (includes roof structure details such as hip and gable roofforms), LOD 3 with several iconic buildings modeled to to mimic their real-world aesthetic (examples are: US Bank Building, Miller Park, and Milwaukee City Hall). Highlights of the model include the differentiation of building components including roof, facades, and ground plane. Data is made available as a single Multipatch feature class consisting of over 400,000 individual building models.]",
