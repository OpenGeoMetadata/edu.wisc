Flights occurred in the Spring of 2010 for the entire State of Wisconsin, resulting in a leaf-off aerial photo product. Re-flights were necessary for the eastern 4 mi of Columbia Co., parts of NW Oconto Co, and the south half of Lincoln Co. during the spring of 2011. County mosaics are available as JPEG 2000 files (.JP2) at 10:1 compression.",
