The aerial imagery was collected on: 4/5, 4/7, 4/11, 4/16, 4/18, 4/19, 4/20, and 4/21 using an UltraCam Eagle M2 and M3 mounted in a fixed-wing aircraft. Aerial imagery was collected to support 0.25 foot ground sample distance (GSD) orthoimagery to meet ASPRS Class II horizontal accuracy specifications at 1' = 50' map scale. The 3-inch pixel orthoimagery was produced to meet or exceed a horizontal accuracy of 0.7 feet RMSE according to ASPRS Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data. Resultant orthoimagery was rectified to a DEM created from LiDAR collected in 2015 and 2017. Orthoimagery was delivered in GeoTiff tiles according to SEWRPC tiling and naming scheme. The project area covers approximately 2,258 square miles. Kenosha and Milwaukee counties were flown in a separate project by EagleView (formerly Pictometry). The Wisconsin Regional Orthoimagery Consortium (WROC) is a multi-entity group of county members and partners led by regional planning commissions (RPCs) and WROC representatives from Ayres Associates. The goal of the consortium is to build and sustain a multi-participant program to acquire digital orthoimagery and elevation data throughout Wisconsin. Orthoimagery was collected for SEWRPC 2020 to provide consistent deliverable products and accuracy standards for each of the participating entities.", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dct_provenance_s": "WisconsinView", "layer_id_s": "", "layer_slug_s": "411115d3-8b81-4e47-a529-48f5ffc179a9", "layer_geom_type_s": "Raster", "dc_format_s": "MrSID", "dc_language_s": "English", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Aerial Imagery"], "dc_creator_sm": ["Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission"], "dc_publisher_sm": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_subject_sm": ["Imagery and Base Maps"], "dct_spatial_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "", "dct_temporal_sm": ["2020"], "solr_year_i": 2020, "dct_references_s": "{\"https://openindexmaps.org\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/indexes/Washington_Imagery_2020.geojson\" ,\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/WROC2020_SEWRPC_project_metadata_RML.xml\"}", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-88.423004, -88.03435, 43.548137, 43.188179)", "uw_supplemental_s": "Archived dataset at UW-Madison.
