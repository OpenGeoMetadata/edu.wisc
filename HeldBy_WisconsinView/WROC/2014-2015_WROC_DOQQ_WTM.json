The coverage area included 41 counties in Wisconsin and was flown in spring 2014 and spring 2015 under leaf-off conditions. Resultant orthoimagery was rectified to new DEMs created from the acquired imagery and existing LiDAR where available. 18-inch pixel resolution orthoimagery was delivered in county mosaics (MrSID) and DOQQs (GeoTIFF) by county.",
