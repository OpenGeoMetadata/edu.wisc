	"dc_description_s": "Ayres Associates was contracted through the North Central Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission (NCWRPC) for the creation of 12-inch pixel resolution county mosaics and DOQQ tiles from the native resolution digital orthoimagery produced under the Wisconsin Regional Orthoimagery Consortium (WROC) in 2018-20. This project established county mosaics and DOQQ tiles for state and federal partners using WROC member data acquired under the Consortium. The coverage area included all 72 counties in Wisconsin which was flown in spring 2018, spring 2019, and spring 2020 under leaf-off conditions. The 4-band (RGB-NIR) aerial imagery was collected using Vexcel UltraCam Eagle, Leica ADS 100, and Leica DMCIII sensors outfitted in a fixed-wing aircraft with onboard GNSS/IMU systems and gyro-stabilized mounts. The native resolution aerial imagery was acquired to support 3-inch, 6-inch, and 12-inch ground sample distance (GSD) specifications. Resultant orthoimagery was rectified to DEMs created from new and existing LiDAR data. Orthoimagery was delivered in GeoTIFF format. The re-sampled statewide 4-band, 12-inch pixel DOQQ orthoimagery was produced to meet or exceed a horizontal accuracy standard of 4.8 feet at 95% confidence level according to ASPRS positional accuracy standards for digital geospatial data.",
