This dataset contains a single file covering the geographic extent of the entire county. Hillshading is a technique used to visualize terrain as shaded relief, illuminating it with a hypothetical light source. The illumination value for each raster cell is determined by its orientation to the light source, which is based on slope and aspect.",
