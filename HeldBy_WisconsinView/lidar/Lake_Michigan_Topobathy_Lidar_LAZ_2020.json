 "dc_description_s": "This data represents LiDAR-derived classified LAS points (compressed to LAZ format) for the Lake Michigan coast in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin in 2020.  [These data are LAZ (compressed LAS) format file(s) containing LIDAR point cloud data. These files contain classified topo/bathy lidar data generated from data collected by the Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging Lidar (CZMIL) system. CZMIL integrates a lidar sensor with simultaneous topographic and bathymetric capabilities, a digital camera and a hyperspectral imager on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. Native lidar data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, were provided to the NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 National Adjustment of 2011 (NAD83 (2011)). Vertical positions were referenced to the NAD83 (2011) ellipsoid and provided in meters. The 3-D position data were sub-divided into a series of LAZ files, which are tiled into 1-km by 1-km boxes defined by the Military Grid Reference System.]",
