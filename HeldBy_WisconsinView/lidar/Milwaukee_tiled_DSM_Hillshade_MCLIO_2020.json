A Digital Surface Model captures both the natural and built/artificial features of the environment. Hillshading is a technique used to visualize terrain as shaded relief, illuminating it with a hypothetical light source. The illumination value for each raster cell is determined by its orientation to the light source, which is based on slope and aspect.",
