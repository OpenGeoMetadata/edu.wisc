 "dc_description_s": "This data represents a LiDAR-derived 2-ft First Return Intensity Image for Juneau County, Wisconsin in 2021. This dataset has 2-ft by 2-ft grid cells, and is in the WISCRS coordinate system for Juneau County: EPSG 7587. LiDAR intensity is recorded as the return strength of a laser beam. It is a bi-product, provided as an integer number between 1-256. This number varies with the composition of the surface object reflecting the laser beam. A low number indicates low reflectivity while a high number indicates high reflectivity. The intensity of the laser beam return can also be affected by the angle of arrival (scan angle), range, surface composition, roughness, and moisture content.",
