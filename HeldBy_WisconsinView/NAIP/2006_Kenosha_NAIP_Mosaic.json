NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 3 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP); and, 2 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified to within +/- 10 meters of reference DOQQs. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75'x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. This file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle tiles that cover a county. MrSID (MG3) compression, with mosaic option, was used. Target values for the compression ratio are (15:1) and compression levels(9) are used.Wisconsin 2006 NAIP imagery is 2 meter GSD orthoimagery.", "dct_spatial_sm": [""], "dc_creator_sm": ["U.S. Department of Agriculture"], "layer_id_s": "", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_identifier_s": "22e8fcdc-98f5-4c6e-894c-7bd91003c0f2", "dct_provenance_s": "WisconsinView", "dc_title_s": "NAIP Aerial Mosaic (UTM) Kenosha County, WI 2006", "layer_slug_s": "22e8fcdc-98f5-4c6e-894c-7bd91003c0f2", "dc_format_s": "MrSID", "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/url\":\"https://naip-usdaonline.hub.arcgis.com/\",\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://web.s3.wisc.edu/wsco-wisconsinview/imagery/NAIP/NAIP_2006/Kenosha/Kenosha_sid.zip\",\"http://www.isotc211.org/schemas/2005/gmd/\":\"https://gisdata.wisc.edu/public/metadata/wi_naip_2006.xml\"}", "dct_isPartOf_sm": ["Aerial Imagery", "Coastal"], "dct_temporal_sm": ["2006"], "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-88.30596091,-87.80280101,42.66945083,42.49293713)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_language_s": "English", "layer_modified_dt": "2024-01-18T19:30:22Z"}
